        Junior front-end developer. At the moment, I have half a year of
        experience in the implementation of non-commercial projects. I prefer to
        work with React, Redux and JS technologies, but also nice to improve
        Node.js skills. In React I have worked with css, sass modules and a
        little with styled-components library. I am looking for full-time
        position in a product company. Place to work - Kyiv or remotelyðŸš€
